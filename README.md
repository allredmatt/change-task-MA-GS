# Change Task - MA GS

## Exec summary
PixelQuest face the following challenges to there business:

1. Player Engagement: The studio lacks an integrated platform for players to connect, share experiences, and access post-launch content. This has limited community engagement and loyalty compared to competitors who offer interactive apps or web platforms.
2. Feedback and Analytics: PixelQuest has no centralised system to gather, analyse, and act on player feedback. Feedback is currently collected via multiple unconnected channels (social media, emails, forums), making it inefficient to track trends or prioritise improvements.
3. Developer Efficiency: Internally, the development team uses outdated tools and manual processes for tracking progress, bug reports, and cross-department collaboration, leading to delays and miscommunications.
4. Monetisation Opportunities: The studio has no digital storefront for microtransactions, DLCs, or subscriptions. Players must purchase games via third-party platforms, limiting potential revenue streams and personalisation of offers.

## Proposed solutions

For 3. Is building a solution best method. 3rd party options very good (would they work out cheaper). Provide training for staff on this. Looks like a separate project. Build data of improvements from using 3rd party tools to form a picture of how changes have been successful.

1, 2 and 4. Develop an app with:
- Micro transactions and DLC for main games.
- Could add mini-games into app with paid for content (paid games, free to play for first levels, ads)
- Store front for above + payment processing
- Forum in app for players, used to monitor players attitudes to game, official feedback channels in forum.
- Surveys or forum posts (e.g. bots asking for experience of game) automated pipeline for gathering feedback from app.
- Gather user data of using app and analyse impact of these.
