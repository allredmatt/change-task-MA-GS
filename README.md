## Exec summary

## Proposed solutions

For 3. Is building a solution best method. 3rd party options very good (would they work out cheaper). Provide training for staff on this. Looks like a separate project. Build data of improvements from using 3rd party tools to form a picture of how changes have been successful.

- Store front for above + payment processing
- Forum in app for players, used to monitor players attitudes to game, official feedback channels in forum.
- Surveys or forum posts (e.g. bots asking for experience of game) automated pipeline for gathering feedback from app.
